# Thoery of Computing Extra Credit

1. for extra credit, I created five turing machines to be used in project 2 and shared them with the rest of the class. Two of these are non-deterministic and three are deteministic. Together with the a plus NTM provided, these files create three NTM with DTM counterparts to be used for testing and comparison in the second project.

2. I chose to do this extra credit because I strugled with mapping machines on the first exams and was particularly struggling with the machines on homework 8. Doing this excersise helped me to practice drawing out turing machines and transposing those rules into code. This forced me to think harder about the machine design to ensure that the machines worked properly for the project. As a result, I am a lot more comfortable creating turing machines as well as thinking throught he logic for PDA's and DFA's.

3. Each of these csv files represents a turing machine in the format outlined by the project 2 instructions. The csv files are the following:   <br />
   - data_a_plus_DTM_ncichosk.csv: A deterministic turing machine that recognizes the language {w | w = a+}  <br />
   - data_abc_star_ncichosk.csv: A nondeterministic turing machine that recognizes the language {w | w = a*b*c*}   <br />
   - data_abc_star_DTM_ncichosk.csv: A deterministic turing machine that recognizes the language {w | w = a*b*c*}   <br />
   - data_equal_01s_ncichosk.csv: A nondeterministic turing machine that recognizes the language {w | w has the same number of 0s and 1s}   <br />
   - data_equal_01s_DTM_ncichosk.csv: A deterministic turing machine that recognizes the language {w | w has the same number of 0s and 1s}
